## Background

</p>


In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, the insurance industry faces significant challenges in providing seamless, trustworthy, and efficient services to customers. Traditional methods of interacting with insurance agents are often time-consuming, impersonal, and prone to errors, creating barriers to accessing and understanding insurance policies. Furthermore, many consumers struggle with the complexity of policy selection and the intricate process of filing claims, leading to confusion, dissatisfaction, and even rejection of claims.

To address these challenges, there is a growing need to revolutionize how insurance is delivered and experienced. By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence, we can develop an AI-powered humanoid agent that transforms the insurance journey for consumers. This intelligent platform will simplify the process by offering 24/7 personalized guidance through voice, video, or chat, ensuring consumers can make informed decisions with ease. Moreover, it will educate customers, providing clear explanations of policy terms and disclosures to build trust and promote financial literacy.

The most immediate and impactful solution lies in streamlining the application process, particularly through an AI-powered form-filling assistant. This assistant will automate tedious paperwork, reducing human error and increasing claim acceptance rates. By making insurance more accessible and transparent, this innovative approach will foster a user-friendly experience, improve consumer satisfaction, and enhance the overall insurance penetration, ultimately ensuring that insurance works for everyone.

This AI-driven solution has the potential to not only transform customer service but also pave the way for a more efficient and consumer-centric insurance industry.


## WHY AI/ML for Insurance-Companies?


   
Insurance is a well-established and highly regulated sector. This has contributed to the industry's slower adoption of technological innovations compared to others. Many insurance companies still rely heavily on manual, paper-based processes, which are not only time-consuming but also require significant human effort. Customers often face lengthy paperwork and bureaucratic hurdles when filing claims or signing up for new policies. Additionally, many policies are not personalized to meet individual needs, causing customers to pay for coverage that may not be entirely relevant to them. In an era where most daily tasks are handled online and with ease, the insurance experience can still feel outdated and frustrating.

However, the landscape is shifting as insurance companies globally begin to invest in advanced technologies to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve security. Recent years have seen a notable increase in insurers exploring and adopting Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions.

According to McKinsey, the insurance industry could unlock an annual value of up to $1.1 trillion through the full implementation of AI technologies. The most promising areas for AI impact include:

Sales and Marketing: Machine learning can be leveraged to offer more competitive and personalized pricing for insurance policies. It enables insurers to recommend tailored products based on individual lifestyles and needs, ensuring customers only pay for what is necessary. This personalization not only makes insurance more appealing to a broader audience but also encourages first-time buyers to consider insurance.

Risk Management: AI, particularly neural networks, can identify patterns associated with fraudulent claims, reducing the incidence of fraud. In the U.S., non-health insurance fraud costs an estimated $40 billion annually, adding $400 to $700 in additional premiums for the average household. Machine learning can also enhance insurers' risk models and actuarial assessments, allowing for the development of more profitable and accurate insurance products.

Operations: AI-powered chatbots, utilizing neural networks, can handle the majority of customer inquiries via email, chat, and phone. This automation frees up valuable time and resources, enabling insurers to focus on higher-value tasks and improve overall operational efficiency.

There is a need for a technology platform to **Revolutionize the operation of Insurance Sector** and that's how our project **Smart AI Insurance** jumps in!
## What is Smart AI Insurance?


**Smart AI Insurance** is the concatenation of Insurance Company and Customers which together stands as the **Gateway of Insurance-Sector**. Our software is a web application that utilizes cutting-edge modern technologies to *Revolutionize the existing Insurance-Claiming and handling system*! *Smart AI Insurance* is a complete AI-based Insurance handling for everyone, including Customers, Agents & is directly connected with the Perticular Insurance company. It has also a dataset of list of mechanics and are arranged according to the ratings and views for a perticular need of our choice. Please follow through to explore!

A further explanation of how each of these works can be found in the Engineering section below.

### Features 

AI-Insurance currently supports all of the following features!

> 1. To interact with the customer with an AI based Virtual Assistance.
> 2. It gives the coustomer all the possible details about the insurance policy they wants to know.
> 3. It can also file a claim for us in case we come out with an accident.
> 4. The insurance moderator can check the claims or policy request accordingly.
> 5. Manually applying for a new policy of insurance.
> 6. Manually applying for a claim to the company.
> 7. It can assign us or recommend us mechanics around us with some good ratings and views depending upon our car-damage.
> 8. It can also help us to check with the claim status.
> 9. Most importantly this project has a hastle free password-less login page with **SAWO AUTH API**.
> 10. It can detect the car damage type for the insurance company to assist the moderator to take action accordingly.
> 11. Distinguishable dashboard pages for all of the above.

**So, how everything works?**

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Ayanghosh-agno/AI_Insurance/blob/main/images/persona.png" />
</p>

> 1. Insurance policy documents are uploaded to Watson Discovery, and then annotated using Watson's Smart Document Understanding tool.
> 2. Mechanic review documents are uploaded to Watson Knowledge Studio, and then annotated to create custom entities and relationships.
> 3. User chats via web-application UI to talk to Watson Assistant.

> 6. The User can also apply for a new policy manualy through it which is backed by a insurance moderator.

## Takeaways 


### What we learned
A lot of things, both summed up in technical & non-technical sides. Also not to mention, We had enhanced our googling and Stackoverflow searching skill during the hackathon and beside that we had learned a lot about the IBM-Cloud :)


### Accomplishments
We had explored so many things within few days. It was a tad difficult for us to collaborate with every stack including the frontend backend and the IBM cloud but We are proud of finishing the project on time which seemed like a tough task initially but happily implemented every thing what We had thought of. Lastly, we think the impact of our project could have a significant accomplishment. Especially, trailing the current scenario of COVID19, this could really be a product that both the people and the insurance-company can find useful!

### What's next for Smart AI Insurance
As previously mentioned, *Smart AI Insurance* is one of the **most technically sound** projects We have made till now, and We would love to expand the wings of our project beyond the hackathon. Apart from fine-tuning the project, We are also planning to give the project with some more features in the operational side which can increase its usability more and can be more effective. 

**Some of them are**:-

> 1. To implement a ML model which can help the company with the damage detection capabilities.
> 2. Facial recogniton, to find the database of the particular customer.
> 3. Number plate detection of the car, So the company can match the database with it.

we're also planning to integrate new user-intuitive features such as refined User access, easy checkout option, adding more such IoT-based inter-device support for maximizing our audience interaction.Though the project basically focuses on the **AUTO-INSURANCE** we can also give some of the features more to use in different Insurance-Sectors. Apart from these, a lot of code needs to be refactored which does include CSS improvements for desktop preview as I couldn't hit so much under 24 hrs. Overall, I hope that one day this project can be widely used among the Insurance community to redefine the existing & remove the backlogs.
